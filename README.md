## 📖 About
**Learning Dashboard** is a modern, interactive progress tracker designed to help students manage their study topics efficiently.

Built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, this application demonstrates advanced state management patterns using the **Context API**, creating a seamless user experience with persistent data storage and dynamic theming.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, CSS3 (Custom Modules)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **State Management:** React Context API (Global), React Hooks (Local)
* **Storage:** LocalStorage (Data persistence)
* **Development Flow:** Vibe Coding (AI-Assisted Development)

## ✨ Highlights & Features
* **🌓 Dynamic Theme System:** Built-in Dark/Light mode toggle that saves user preference.
* **📊 Visual Statistics:** Real-time dashboard showing completion rates and progress bars.
* **🔍 Smart Filtering:** Sort topics by status (Active/Completed), difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), or search by name.
* **💾 Data Persistence:** Uses LocalStorage to ensure your learning progress is never lost on refresh.
* **🧩 Component Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (`TopicForm`, `TopicList`, `StatsBar`).

## 🤖 Development Approach: "Vibe Coding"
This project was developed using a modern **"Vibe Coding"** workflow.
I leveraged AI-assisted tools to accelerate UI boilerplate generation and CSS styling, allowing me to focus my efforts on:
* Implementing strict **Type Safety** with TypeScript interfaces.
* Designing a robust **Global State** logic with Context API.
* Refining the UX and responsiveness.
